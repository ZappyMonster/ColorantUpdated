## Components

### The Colorant project comprises several Python files:

- main.py: This is the main executable of the application that initiates the color tracking process and manages key events.

- colorant.py: Houses the Colorant class, which manages image processing and color tracking tasks.

- other.py: Contains the Mouse and Settings classes for Arduino communication and settings configuration, respectively. The Capture class responsible for screen capture operations is also defined here.

- settings.ini: TA configuration file that stores various settings for colorant.

## Installation

You can either clone the repository and run the Python script directly, or you can [download](https://github.com/hafyzwithawhy/Colorant/releases/latest) the precompiled executable from the releases page. The latest release is v1.0, released on 23 May 2023. This version is compiled into an executable for easier usage, and it doesn't require Python or any dependencies to be installed.
